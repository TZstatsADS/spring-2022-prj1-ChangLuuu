### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2022

+ Projec title: Do Philosophy works have emotion and how are they developing
+ This project is conducted by [Chang Lu]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] This project seeks to find out whether the sentiment in different schools and philosophers are neutral or not, and whether the sentiment of a specific school becomes neutral over time. The conclusion is philosophy works do have emotions, and different schools and authors have different emotion in their work. As schools develop, they all become more objective and rational, meaning they become more like a scientific discipline.
